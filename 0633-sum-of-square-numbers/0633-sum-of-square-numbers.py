### Solution 1: Sqrt
# Since a^2 + b^2 = c => a = sqrt(c - b^2) => a <= sqrt(c).
# Traverse a in range [0..sqrt(c)], check if there exists bSquare (where bSquare = c - a^2) and bSquare is a square number then return True.
class Solution:
    def judgeSquareSum(self, c: int) -> bool:
        for a in range(int(sqrt(c))+1):
            b = sqrt(c - a*a)
            if b == int(b):
                return True
        return False
# ## Complexity

# # Time: O(sqrt(c) * logC), where c <= 2^31-1.
# # The operation sqrt(x) takes O(logX), can check this problem 69. Sqrt(x).
# # Space: O(1)

# ### Solution 2: Using HashSet

# # Pre-compute squares number in range [0...c] and add to our HashSet, let say squareSet.
# # Iterate aSquare in squareSet, if there exists bSquare (where bSquare = c - aSquare) in the squareSet then return True.
# class Solution:
#     def judgeSquareSum(self, c: int) -> bool:
#         squareSet = set()
#         for x in range(int(math.sqrt(c)) + 1):
#             squareSet.add(x * x)

#         for aSquare in squareSet:
#             bSquare = c - aSquare
#             if bSquare in squareSet:
#                 return True
#         return False
# # Complexity

# # Time: O(sqrt(c)), where c <= 2^31-1
# # Space: O(sqrt(c))

# ### Solution 3: Two Pointers

# # We can use Two Pointers to search a pair of (left, right), so that left^2 + right^2 = c.
# # Start with left = 0, right = int(sqrt(c)).
# # while left <= right:
# # Let cur = left^2 + right^2.
# # If cur == c then we found a perfect match -> return True
# # Else if cur < c, we need to increase cur, so left += 1.
# # Else we need to decrease cur, so right -= 1.
# class Solution:
#     def judgeSquareSum(self, c: int) -> bool:
#         left = 0
#         right = int(sqrt(c))
#         while left <= right:
#             cur = left * left + right * right
#             if cur == c: return True
#             if cur < c:
#                 left += 1
#             else:
#                 right -= 1
#         return False
# # Complexity

# # Time: O(sqrt(c)), where c <= 2^31-1
# # Space: O(1)
