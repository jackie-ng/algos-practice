"""
If s[i] == s[j], then one valid palindrome is to take both ends plus the best inside: L(i,j) = 2 + L(i+1, j-1).

Why correct: Any optimal palindromic subsequence either uses both these matching ends or it doesn't. If they match, taking both cannot make the best smaller because we can always place s[i] at the front and s[j] at the end of some palindrome inside s[i+1..j-1]. Hence at least 2 + L(i+1,j-1) is achievable. Optimality: any optimal palindrome that uses both ends has that form; if best does not use both ends, the next case covers it.

If s[i] != s[j], then at least one of s[i] or s[j] is not used in any palindrome that uses the other as its mirror; so the optimal must lie in either s[i+1..j] or s[i..j-1]. Therefore:

L(i,j) = max( L(i+1, j), L(i, j-1) ).


Formal induction: For substrings shorter than current length, assume L is correct. The recurrence enumerates the two mutually exclusive cases (matching ends or not) and picks the best â€” therefore by induction it is correct.
